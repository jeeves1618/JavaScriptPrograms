DOM - Document Object Model is the structured representation of HTML documents. Allows JS and CSS to accesses HTML elements and styles to manipulate them.
DOM is not part of JavaScript. It is part of WEB APIs.

Basics of HTML
	- classes and Ids
	- Classes doesn't have to be unique. Ids have to be unique
	- When you put form elements in a section, it makes sense to change div to form
	
Basics of CSS
	- sytle sheet is linked through link and rel=stylesheet within HTML
	- Standard HTML elements are accessed by their names within the style sheet. Example:  body {font-family : Arial }
	- Classes are accessed through dot operator. Example: .first {font-family : Comic }
	- Ids are accessed through # operator. Example: #first {font-family : Comic }
	- if you want to apply a style to all sections, use the * operator. * {font-family : Arial}
	
Back to JS
	- Selecting an element in JavaScript - document.querySelector('.first') 
	- JavaScript accesses HTML elements in the same way as CSS. 
	- document.querySelector('.first') will give the value of the element identified by the class 'first'. To change the value, just assign the new value document.querySelector('.first') = 'New Value'
	- To get the value use the textContent property. document.querySelector('.first').textContent will give the value 
	- To get the value from a input field, use document.querySelector('.first').value
	
So far, we are not capturing any events from the web page.

Handling Click Events
	- In order to get the data from the text box on the click of the button (class = "btn two") by adding a listener for the action and function to do what needs to be done on that action. 
	- Here we have a text box with the class boxer and a button with the class "btn two". We can access the data entered in the text box and display it in console log on the click of the button as below
	document.querySelector('.two').addEventListener 
	('click', function(){
		console.log(document.querySelector('.boxer').value);
		}
